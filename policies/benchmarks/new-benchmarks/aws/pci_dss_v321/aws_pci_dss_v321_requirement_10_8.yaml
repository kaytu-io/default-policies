Title: 10.8 Additional requirement for service providers only to implement a process for the timely detection and reporting of failures of critical security control systems, including but not limited to failure of firewalls, IDS/IPS, FIM, anti-virus, physical access controls, logical access controls, audit logging mechanisms and segmentation controls
SectionCode: "8"
Description: "Note: This requirement applies only when the entity being assessed is a service provider. Without formal processes to detect and alert when critical security controls fail, failures may go undetected for extended periods and provide attackers ample time to compromise systems and steal sensitive data from the cardholder data environment. The specific types of failures may vary depending on the function of the device and technology in use. Typical failures include a system ceasing to perform its security function or not functioning in its intended manner; for example, a firewall erasing all its rules or going offline."
