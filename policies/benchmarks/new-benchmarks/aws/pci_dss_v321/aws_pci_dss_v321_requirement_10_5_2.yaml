Title: 10.5.2 Current audit trail files are protected from unauthorized modifications via access control mechanisms, physical segregation, and/or network segregation
SectionCode: "2"
Description: Adequate protection of the audit logs includes strong access control (limit access to logs based on “need to know” only), and use of physical or network segregation to make the logs harder to find and modify. Promptly backing up the logs to a centralized log server or media that is difficult to alter keeps the logs protected even if the system generating the logs becomes compromised. Protect audit trail files from unauthorized modifications.
