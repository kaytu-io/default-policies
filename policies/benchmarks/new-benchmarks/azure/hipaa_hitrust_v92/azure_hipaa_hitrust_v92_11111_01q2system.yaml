Description: When PKI-based authentication is used, the information system validates certificates by constructing and verifying a certification path to an accepted trust anchor, including checking certificate status information; enforces access to the corresponding private key; maps the identity to the corresponding account of the individual or group; and implements a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and validation in case of an inability to access revocation information via the network.
