Title: Route53 domains privacy protection should be enabled
Description: Ensure that your AWS Route 53 domains have Privacy Protection feature
  enabled in order to hide all their contact information from WHOIS queries and reduce
  the amount of spam received. The feature allows you to conceal your personal phone
  number, email and physical address for the domain names registered and/or transferred
  to AWS Route 53 service.
