Title: Ensure IAM password policy requires at least one lowercase letter
Description: Password policies, in part, enforce password complexity requirements.
  Use IAM password policies to ensure that passwords use different character sets.
  Security Hub recommends that the password policy require at least one lowercase
  letter. Setting a password complexity policy increases account resiliency against
  brute force login attempts.
