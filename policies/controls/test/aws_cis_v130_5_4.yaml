Title: 5.4 Ensure routing tables for VPC peering are 'least access'
Description: A VPC comes with a default security group whose initial settings deny
  all inbound traffic, allow all outbound traffic, and allow all traffic between instances
  assigned to the security group. If you don't specify a security group when you launch
  an instance, the instance is automatically assigned to this default security group.
  Security groups provide stateful filtering of ingress/egress network traffic to
  AWS resources. It is recommended that the default security group restrict all traffic.
