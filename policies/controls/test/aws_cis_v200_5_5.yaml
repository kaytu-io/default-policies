Title: 5.5 Ensure routing tables for VPC peering are \"least access\
Description: Once a VPC peering connection is established, routing tables must be
  updated to establish any connections between the peered VPCs. These routes can be
  as specific as desired - even peering a VPC to only a single host on the other side
  of the connection.
