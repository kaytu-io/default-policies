Title: 7 Elasticsearch domains should be configured with at least three dedicated
  master nodes
Description: This control checks whether Elasticsearch domains are configured with
  at least three dedicated master nodes. This control fails if the domain does not
  use dedicated master nodes. This control passes if Elasticsearch domains have five
  dedicated master nodes. However, using more than three master nodes might be unnecessary
  to mitigate the availability risk, and will result in additional cost.
