Title: 2 DynamoDB tables should have point-in-time recovery enabled
Description: This control checks whether point-in-time recovery (PITR) is enabled
  for an Amazon DynamoDB table. Backups help you to recover more quickly from a security
  incident. They also strengthen the resilience of your systems. DynamoDB point-in-time
  recovery automates backups for DynamoDB tables. It reduces the time to recover from
  accidental delete or write operations. DynamoDB tables that have PITR enabled can
  be restored to any point in time in the last 35 days.
