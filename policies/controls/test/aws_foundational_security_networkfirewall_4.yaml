Title: 4 The default stateless action for Network Firewall policies should be drop
  or forward for full packets
Description: A firewall policy defines how your firewall monitors and handles traffic
  in Amazon VPC. You configure stateless and stateful rule groups to filter packets
  and traffic flows. Defaulting to Pass can allow unintended traffic.
