Title: CloudTrail trail log file validation should be enabled
Description: 'Utilize AWS CloudTrail log file validation to check the integrity of
  CloudTrail logs. Log file validation helps determine if a log file was modified
  or deleted or unchanged after CloudTrail delivered it. This feature is built using
  industry standard algorithms: SHA-256 for hashing and SHA-256 with RSA for digital
  signing. This makes it computationally infeasible to modify, delete or forge CloudTrail
  log files without detection.'
