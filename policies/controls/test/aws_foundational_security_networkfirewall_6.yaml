Title: 6 Stateless network firewall rule group should not be empty
Description: A rule group contains rules that define how your firewall processes traffic
  in your VPC. An empty stateless rule group when present in a firewall policy might
  give the impression that the rule group will process traffic. However, when the
  stateless rule group is empty, it does not process traffic.
