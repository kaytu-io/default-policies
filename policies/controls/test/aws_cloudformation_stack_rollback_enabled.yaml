Title: CloudFormation stacks should have rollback enabled
Description: Ensure CloudFormation stacks have the rollback feature enabled. Rollback
  triggers enable you to have AWS CloudFormation monitor the state of your application
  during stack creation and updating, and to rollback that operation if the application
  breaches the threshold of any of the alarms you've specified.
