Title: 1.13 Ensure MFA is enabled for the \"root\" account
Description: The root account is the most privileged user in an AWS account. MFA adds
  an extra layer of protection on top of a user name and password. With MFA enabled,
  when a user signs in to an AWS website, they will be prompted for their user name
  and password as well as for an authentication code from their AWS MFA device.
