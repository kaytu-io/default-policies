Title: 5.4 Ensure that Azure Monitor Resource Logging is Enabled for All Services that Support it
Description: Resource Logs capture activity to the data access plane while the Activity log is a subscription-level log for the control plane. Resource-level diagnostic logs provide insight into operations that were performed within that resource itself; for example, reading or updating a secret from a Key Vault.
