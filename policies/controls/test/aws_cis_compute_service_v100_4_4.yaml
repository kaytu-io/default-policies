Title: 4.4 Ensure least privilege is used with Lambda function access
Description: Lambda is fully integrated with IAM, allowing you to control precisely
  what each Lambda function can do within the AWS Cloud. As you develop a Lambda function,
  you expand the scope of this policy to enable access to other resources. For example,
  for a function that processes objects put into an S3 bucket, it requires read access
  to objects stored in that bucket.
