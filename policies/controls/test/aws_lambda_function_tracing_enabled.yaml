Title: Lambda functions tracing should be enabled
Description: AWS X-Ray can be used to visualize the components of application, identify
  performance bottlenecks, and troubleshoot requests that resulted in an error. Lambda
  functions send trace data to X-Ray, and X-Ray processes the data to generate a service
  map and searchable trace summaries.
