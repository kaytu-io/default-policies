Title: VPC security groups should restrict ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to mongoDB
  ports 27017 and 27018
Description: This control checks whether the VPC security groups that are in use allow
  ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to mongoDB ports 27017 and 27018. Optionally the
  rule checks whether the port numbers are listed in the authorizedTcpPorts parameter.
  This control passes when none of the rules in a security group allow ingress traffic
  from 0.0.0.0/0 from ports 27017 and 27018.
