Title: EMR public access should be blocked at account level
Description: The block public access feature prevents a cluster in a public subnet
  from launching when any security group associated with the cluster has a rule that
  allows inbound traffic from IPv4 0.0.0.0/0 or IPv6 ::/0 (public access) on a port,
  unless the port has been specified as an exception - port 22 is an exception by
  default. This feature is enabled by default for each AWS Region in your AWS account
  and is not recommended to be turned off.
