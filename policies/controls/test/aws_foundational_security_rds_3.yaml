Title: 3 RDS DB instances should have encryption at rest enabled
Description: This control checks whether storage encryption is enabled for your Amazon
  RDS DB instances. This control is intended for RDS DB instances. However, it can
  also generate findings for Aurora DB instances, Neptune DB instances, and Amazon
  DocumentDB clusters. If these findings are not useful, then you can suppress them.
