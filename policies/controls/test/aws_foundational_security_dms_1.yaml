Title: 1 AWS Database Migration Service replication instances should not be public
Description: This control checks whether AWS DMS replication instances are public.
  To do this, it examines the value of the PubliclyAccessible field. A private replication
  instance has a private IP address that you cannot access outside of the replication
  network. A replication instance should have a private IP address when the source
  and target databases are in the same network. The network must also be connected
  to the replication instance's VPC using a VPN, AWS Direct Connect, or VPC peering.
  To learn more about public and private replication instances, see Public and private
  replication instances in the AWS Database Migration Service User Guide.
