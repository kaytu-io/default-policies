Title: 1.15 Ensure IAM Users Receive Permissions Only Through Groups
Description: 'IAM users are granted access to services, functions, and data through
  IAM policies. There are three ways to define policies for a user: 1) Edit the user
  policy directly, aka an inline, or user, policy; 2) attach a policy directly to
  a user; 3) add the user to an IAM group that has an attached policy. Only the third
  implementation is recommended.'
