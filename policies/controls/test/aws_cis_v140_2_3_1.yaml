Title: 2.3.1 Ensure that encryption is enabled for RDS Instances
Description: Amazon RDS encrypted DB instances use the industry standard AES-256 encryption
  algorithm to encrypt your data on the server that hosts your Amazon RDS DB instances.
  After your data is encrypted, Amazon RDS handles authentication of access and decryption
  of your data transparently with a minimal impact on performance.
