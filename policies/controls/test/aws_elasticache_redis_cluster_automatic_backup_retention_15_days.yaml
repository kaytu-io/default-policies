Title: ElastiCache Redis cluster automatic backup should be enabled with retention
  period of 15 days or greater
Description: When automatic backups are enabled, AWS ElastiCache creates a backup
  of the cluster on a daily basis. The backup can be retained for a number of days
  as specified by your organization. Automatic backups can help guard against data
  loss.
