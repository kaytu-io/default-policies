Title: 1.17 Maintain current contact details
Description: Ensure contact email and telephone details for AWS accounts are current
  and map to more than one individual in your organization. An AWS account supports
  a number of contact details, and AWS will use these to contact the account owner
  if activity judged to be in breach of Acceptable Use Policy or indicative of likely
  security compromise is observed by the AWS Abuse team. Contact details should not
  be for a single individual, as circumstances may arise where that individual is
  unavailable.
