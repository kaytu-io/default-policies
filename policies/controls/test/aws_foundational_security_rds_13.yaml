Title: 13 RDS automatic minor version upgrades should be enabled
Description: This control checks whether automatic minor version upgrades are enabled
  for the RDS database instance. Enabling automatic minor version upgrades ensures
  that the latest minor version updates to the relational database management system
  (RDBMS) are installed. These upgrades might include security patches and bug fixes.
  Keeping up to date with patch installation is an important step in securing systems.
