Title: EC2 transit gateways should have auto accept shared attachments disabled
Description: Ensure transit gateways have auto accept shared attachments feature disabled.
  If this setting is disabled, then any VPC that attempts to attach to a transit gateway
  will need to request authorization, and the account that owns the transit gateway
  will need to accept the authorization.
