Title: 3.2 Ensure CloudTrail log file validation is enabled
Description: CloudTrail log file validation creates a digitally signed digest file
  containing a hash of each log that CloudTrail writes to S3. These digest files can
  be used to determine whether a log file was changed, deleted, or unchanged after
  CloudTrail delivered the log. It is recommended that file validation be enabled
  on all CloudTrails.
