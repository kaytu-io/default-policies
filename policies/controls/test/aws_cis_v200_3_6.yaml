Title: 3.6 Ensure S3 bucket access logging is enabled on the CloudTrail S3 bucket
Description: S3 Bucket Access Logging generates a log that contains access records
  for each request made to your S3 bucket. An access log record contains details about
  the request, such as the request type, the resources specified in the request worked,
  and the time and date the request was processed. It is recommended that bucket access
  logging be enabled on the CloudTrail S3 bucket.
