Title: 1 Amazon EMR cluster primary nodes should not have public IP addresses
Description: This control checks whether master nodes on Amazon EMR clusters have
  public IP addresses. The control fails if the master node has public IP addresses
  that are associated with any of its instances. Public IP addresses are designated
  in the PublicIp field of the NetworkInterfaces configuration for the instance. This
  control only checks Amazon EMR clusters that are in a RUNNING or WAITING state.
