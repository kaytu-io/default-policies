Title: Route 53 domains should not be expired
Description: This control identifes any expired domain names registered with AWS Route
  53. When the expired domain names are not restored promptly, they will become available
  for others to register. Restoring on time your Route 53 expired domains will allow
  you to reestablish full control over their registration.
