Title: Ensure IAM password policy requires at least one symbol
Description: Password policies, in part, enforce password complexity requirements.
  Use IAM password policies to ensure that passwords use different character sets.
  Security Hub recommends that the password policy require at least one symbol. Setting
  a password complexity policy increases account resiliency against brute force login
  attempts.
