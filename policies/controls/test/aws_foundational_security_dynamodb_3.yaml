Title: 3 DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) clusters should be encrypted at rest
Description: This control checks whether a DAX cluster is encrypted at rest. Encrypting
  data at rest reduces the risk of data stored on disk being accessed by a user not
  authenticated to AWS. The encryption adds another set of access controls to limit
  the ability of unauthorized users to access to the data. For example, API permissions
  are required to decrypt the data before it can be read.
