Title: 1.5 Ensure MFA is enabled for the 'root' user account
Description: The 'root' user account is the most privileged user in an AWS account.
  Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection on top of a
  username and password. With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to an AWS website,
  they will be prompted for their username and password as well as for an authentication
  code from their AWS MFA device.
