Title: Ensure the key vault is recoverable
Description: The key vault contains object keys, secrets and certificates. Accidental unavailability of a key vault can cause immediate data loss or loss of security functions (authentication, validation, verification, non-repudiation, etc.) supported by the key vault objects. It is recommended the key vault be made recoverable by enabling the "Do Not Purge" and "Soft Delete" functions.
